    <h2>
        Iâ€™m Muhammad Asif, a Web and App Developer (MERN Stack).
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate web and app developer specializing in the MERN stack.  
        I started my web development journey in my 3rd semester and have built multiple projects,  
        ranging from simple interfaces to full-stack applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        After gaining experience in web development and creating professional websites,  
        I expanded my expertise into mobile app development.  
        I have since been working on building responsive, high-performance applications  
        that enhance user experiences across both web and mobile platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies,  
        I strive to develop scalable, efficient, and intuitive digital solutions.
